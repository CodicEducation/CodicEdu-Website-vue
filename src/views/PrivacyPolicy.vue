      <h4>1. Founding principles</h4>
      <p>
        Codic Education AB pledges to respect and protect your personal data and
        integrity according to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR),
        industry regulations and other relevant norms. To get a better
        understanding of how we handle information about you, we have outlined
        the founding principles of our personal data operations in this Privacy
        Policy. Personal data is information that by itself or together with
        other data could be used to identify, locate or contact an individual.
        Names, phone numbers, email, photographs and IP addresses are examples
        of personal data. Management of personal data refers to all kinds of
        practices involving personal data, for example: collection, analysis,
        registration or accumulation. The data controller determines what
        personal data is used as well as the purpose of using the data. It is
        the data controller who is ultimately responsible for the management of
        your personal data, making sure the operations are executed in
        accordance with the GDPR.
      </p>
      <h4>2. Data controllers: Codic Education AB</h4>
      <p>
        The data controller is Codic Education AB, in charge of the management
        of your personal data.
      </p>
      <h4>3. What information do we keep?</h4>
      <p>
        On Codic Education AB’s website, you can register your details. That is
        how we receive information about you, such as your name and how to
        contact you. To improve our services and communication in accordance
        with your preferences, we also ask you - aside of the aforementioned -
        to leave information that may include personal or professional interests
        or your place of living. When you contact us, apply for a job or
        register on our website, you can be asked to leave information about
        yourself. Depending on the situation, we could ask you for the following
        personal data:
      </p>

        <li>Name</li>
        <li>Email</li>
        <li>Phone number</li>

          your IP address and user patterns, the type of browser you use,
          language and information about identifier and operational system.
        </li>

      <h4>4. Information from other sources</h4>

        When you give us your consent and allow us to handle your personal data,
        you also allow us to register other information about you that you may
        have provided in another context. Based on public information, we may
        supplement your registered data with your working title, industry,
        information about previous employment or other contact information. If
        you are our client or looking for consultant opportunities, we could add
        information about how to contact you from previous job applications or
        client projects.

      <h4>10. How we use cookies</h4>
      <p>
        A cookie file is part of a text that - with your consent - can be placed
        in your computer’s hard drive. Your browser will then add the text in a
        separate file. Codic Education AB uses cookies to facilitate the traffic
        analyses on our websites by accessing information about who has visited
        a certain website at a certain time. In the settings of your browser,
        you can choose to accept cookies or not. You are also able to erase
        cookie files that have been placed in your hard drive.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you visit the sections of Codic Education AB’s website that are
        adapted after your user profile or require a login, your browser must be
        set to accept cookies. Aside from that, you can visit our websites
        without disclosing your identity.
      </p>
      <h4>11. Where do we store the information and how do we protect it?</h4>
      <p>
        Codic Education AB protects your personal data through technical and
        organisational safety measures.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your personal information is stored behind secured networks and is only
        accessible for a limited amount of people who have specific rights to
        our systems. These individuals are required to keep your information
        confidential. All information that you provide is encrypted via SSL
        (Secure Socket Layer technology).
      </p>
      <p>
        The data is managed in accordance with the GDPR. All information is
        covered by confidentiality agreements and our personnel only have access

        12. You have the right to access the information we have about you
      </h4>
      <p>
        Codic Education AB endeavours to make sure that all the information we
        manage is correct. This also applies to the personal data we collect. If
        data somehow is revealed to be incorrect, we will immediately rectify
        the problem. You have the right to access your personal data.
      </p>
      <p>
        The GDPR was put into action on the 25th of May 2018. From then on you
        have the right to access the information we have of you in the form of a
        register excerpt. You can also demand that we rectify erroneous
        information about you. You also have the right to withdraw your consent
        if you no longer want us to handle your personal data. If you withdraw
        your consent, we will erase the information we have of you. Observe that
        erasing your personal data can affect the delivery of information within
        the boundaries of a client relationship as well as potentially affect
        current dialogues.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to withdraw your consent or demand a register excerpt,
        correction or erasure, you can contact us via the email address we have
        provided in the chapter for contact details. To access a register
        excerpt, you need to send us an electronic copy of a signed document

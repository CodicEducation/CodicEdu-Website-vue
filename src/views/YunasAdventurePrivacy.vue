            <b>Personal information:</b> The only personally identifiable
            information that is collected and stored in relation to our apps is
            the email used for registration of a player account. The player
            account email will never be shared with any other entities and will

          <p>
            <b>Data retention:</b> If we do happen to obtain any other personal
            information, including other emails than player account email or
            phone numbers perhaps obtained through support requests or other
            correspondence, it will be treated with the strictest
            confidentiality. Any such personal information will never be shared
            with any other entities. Any such personal information will not be
            retained beyond the resolution of the support request or other
            correspondence.

            similar values as expressed on their own published privacy policies.
